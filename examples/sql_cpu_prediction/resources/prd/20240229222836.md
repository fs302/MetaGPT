## Original Requirements

构建一个预测 SQL 的 CPU 计算量的模型，我们可以拿到 SQL 的文本、读取表存储以及实际计算量作为特征和样本标签。我们希望构建的机器学习模型可以用于预测 SQL 的 CPU 计算量，也可以作为分类模型判断一个 SQL 是否是超大计算量的 SQL。

## Project Name

sql_cpu_prediction

## Product Goals

- Accurately predict the CPU computation cost of SQL queries
- Classify SQL queries into categories based on their computation cost
- Optimize the performance of database systems by providing insights into query optimization

## User Stories

- As a database administrator, I want to predict the CPU cost of SQL queries before execution to manage system resources more efficiently
- As a developer, I want to classify SQL queries based on their computation cost to optimize my application's performance
- As a system architect, I want insights into SQL query optimization to design more efficient database systems

## Competitive Analysis

- SQL Server Query Performance Insights: Offers insights but lacks predictive capabilities
- Oracle SQL Tuning Advisor: Provides optimization recommendations but no CPU cost prediction
- Amazon RDS Performance Insights: Monitors database performance but does not classify SQL queries
- Percona Monitoring and Management: Comprehensive database monitoring tool with some optimization features
- Redgate SQL Monitor: Real-time SQL Server performance monitoring, lacking predictive analysis
- SolarWinds Database Performance Analyzer: Performance monitoring with anomaly detection, no specific SQL cost prediction

## Requirement Analysis

The project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the CPU computation cost of SQL queries and classify them based on their computation cost. This requires collecting and analyzing SQL text, table read operations, and actual computation costs as features and labels for model training. The model should help in optimizing database performance by providing insights into query optimization.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Collect and preprocess SQL query data including text, table reads, and CPU costs']
- ['P0', 'Develop a machine learning model to predict SQL query CPU costs']
- ['P1', 'Implement a classification system for SQL queries based on predicted CPU costs']
- ['P1', 'Integrate the model into a user-friendly tool for database administrators and developers']
- ['P2', 'Conduct performance testing and optimization of the model']

## UI Design draft

The user interface will include a dashboard for inputting SQL queries, viewing predictions, and classification results. It will feature a clean and intuitive design, with visual indicators for CPU cost categories (e.g., low, medium, high) and optimization suggestions.
