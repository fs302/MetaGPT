{"Implementation approach":"We will develop a Python-based machine learning application to predict and classify SQL queries by their CPU computation cost. The project will leverage scikit-learn for model development, pandas for data manipulation, and Flask for creating a simple web interface. The application will collect SQL query data, preprocess it, and use it to train a predictive model. The model will then be able to predict CPU costs for new queries and classify them into predefined categories. We will also implement a user-friendly dashboard for interacting with the model.","File list":["main.py","model.py","preprocessor.py","server.py","config.py","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        +run_server() void\n    }\n    class Server {\n        +app Flask\n        +start() void\n        +predict_cpu_cost(sql_query: str) str\n        +classify_query(sql_query: str) str\n    }\n    class Model {\n        -model sklearnModel\n        +train(X: DataFrame, y: Series) void\n        +predict(X: DataFrame) Series\n        +classify(X: DataFrame) Series\n    }\n    class Preprocessor {\n        +preprocess_sql(sql_query: str) DataFrame\n    }\n    class Config {\n        +DB_CONNECTION_STRING str\n        +MODEL_PATH str\n    }\n    Main --> Server\n    Server --> Model\n    Server --> Preprocessor\n    Model --> Preprocessor\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant S as Server\n    participant P as Preprocessor\n    participant MD as Model\n    M->>S: run_server()\n    S->>S: start()\n    loop Prediction Request\n        S->>P: preprocess_sql(sql_query)\n        P-->>S: return DataFrame\n        S->>MD: predict(DataFrame)\n        MD-->>S: return prediction\n    end\n    loop Classification Request\n        S->>P: preprocess_sql(sql_query)\n        P-->>S: return DataFrame\n        S->>MD: classify(DataFrame)\n        MD-->>S: return classification\n    end\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the specific performance metrics to evaluate the model's predictions and classifications.
