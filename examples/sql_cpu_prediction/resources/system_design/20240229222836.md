## Implementation approach

We will develop a Python-based machine learning application to predict and classify SQL queries by their CPU computation cost. The project will leverage scikit-learn for model development, pandas for data manipulation, and Flask for creating a simple web interface. The application will collect SQL query data, preprocess it, and use it to train a predictive model. The model will then be able to predict CPU costs for new queries and classify them into predefined categories. We will also implement a user-friendly dashboard for interacting with the model.

    S->>S: start()

        P-->>S: return DataFrame
        S->>MD: predict(DataFrame)

        P-->>S: return DataFrame
        S->>MD: classify(DataFrame)

    end


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specific performance metrics to evaluate the model's predictions and classifications. Additionally, the method of collecting SQL query data and actual computation costs for training the model needs to be detailed.
